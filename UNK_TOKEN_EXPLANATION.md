# Understanding the <unk> Token Issue

## Why are you seeing mostly `<unk>` tokens?

The Mini LLM is currently generating mostly `<unk>` (unknown) tokens because:

1. **Random Initialization**: The model weights are randomly initialized, not pre-trained. Real language models require extensive training on large text corpora to learn meaningful patterns.

2. **Simplified Architecture**: We've simplified the attention mechanism to work in the browser, which reduces the model's capacity to learn complex patterns.

3. **No Training Data**: The model hasn't been trained on any text data, so it doesn't know language patterns or vocabulary distributions.

## What's Actually Happening

When you input text:
1. The tokenizer converts your text to token IDs
2. The model processes these through randomly initialized layers
3. The output is essentially random noise
4. Most generated token IDs don't correspond to real words in the vocabulary
5. The tokenizer displays these as `<unk>`

## Solutions

### Quick Fix (Demonstration Only)
The code now includes:
- Better weight initialization to reduce extreme values
- Vocabulary size limits to prevent out-of-range tokens
- Debug logging to see what's happening

### Real Solution
To get meaningful text generation, you would need:

1. **Pre-trained Weights**: Load weights from a model trained on text data
2. **Training Pipeline**: Train the model on a text corpus
3. **Better Architecture**: Implement full multi-head attention (complex for browser)

## What You Can Do Now

1. **Lower Temperature**: Set temperature to 0.1-0.3 for less random output
2. **Reduce Top-K**: Set top-K to 5-10 to limit vocabulary choices
3. **Check Console**: Look at browser console for debug information

## Expected Behavior

With random weights, the model will:
- Generate mostly gibberish or `<unk>` tokens
- Occasionally output real tokens by chance
- Not produce coherent text

This is normal for an untrained model and demonstrates the importance of pre-training in language models.

## Next Steps

To make this a functional language model:
1. Implement a training loop
2. Find a small pre-trained model compatible with TensorFlow.js
3. Or use this as a learning tool to understand model architecture

Remember: This implementation showcases the architecture and GPU acceleration, but meaningful text generation requires trained weights!
